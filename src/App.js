          <h3>Who is Marjorie?</h3>
          <p>
            I am a mother who loves traveling the world with my daughter. Prior
            to software engineering I was a nanny. Although I love working with
            children, I finally had the opportunity to pursue my passion for
            software engineering. My passion for learning led me to the grace
            Hopper Program at Full Stack Academy. There, I was able to further
            develop my problem solving, communication and engineering skills.
            For the future I plan on taking these skills with me all over the
            world and potentially implement them in both a work setting and a
            school setting.
